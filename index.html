      <h2>Did you know that...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>About 50% of websites are in English</strong>, making a vast
          amount of information inaccessible to those who don't speak the
          language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unique content exists within each language sector</strong>,
          from scientific research in Japanese to cultural discussions in
          Arabic, or culinary content from Italy.

          translations to further understand nuances.

      <h1>Our Translation API</h1>
      <p>
        Currently we have setup a server that hosts various MarianMT language
        translation machine learning models. While this service isn't as content
        rich as others such as: google translate, we want to explore the open
        source options available and be able to fine-tune the operations for the
        benefit of our users and to ensure success for the future of our
        endeavors.

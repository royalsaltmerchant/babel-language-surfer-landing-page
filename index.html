      <h1>Babel Language Surfer v1</h1>
      <h2>Translate As You Type</h2>

      <p class="indent">
        Babel Language Surfer: Translate as You Type is a browser extension
        designed to streamline the translation of text as users type, without
        the need to copy-paste between tools. With Control + T, users can
        translate their text directly within any input field, enabling a more
        fluid and immersive experience when navigating foreign-language
        websites. Babel Language Surfer is designed to complement tools like
        Google Translate, allowing for seamless communication and browsing in
        multiple languages simultaneously.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Instant Input Translation (Control + T)</strong> - Users can
          type in any input field and press Control + T to trigger the
          translation, which updates the text in real-time as they type. This
          minimizes interruptions and creates a more natural typing flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integration with Full-Page Translators</strong> - BabelFlow
          works in harmony with existing tools like Google Translate, which
          focus on translating entire webpages. Together, these tools allow
          users to navigate and interact with foreign-language websites without
          leaving the page or switching between applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advanced Machine Translation Model</strong> - BabelFlow
          currently uses the marianMT model with the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-mul-en
          training, which supports over 100 languages. The translation process
          is English-centric, meaning text can be translated from any supported
          language to English, and from English to other languages. While we are
          exploring additional models for better support, we aim to optimize the
          balance between translation quality and system performance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        The extension sends text input to a server, which detects the input
        language, translates it using the selected model, and then returns the
        translated text. The translation occurs in the text field when the user
        presses the shortcut Control + T.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Translate your searches to view results in other languages.</li>
        <li>Chat with foreign-language-speaking communities fluidly.</li>
        <li>
          Comment, post, or interact with foreign-language forums or social
          media content.
        </li>
        <li>Translate any document you are making "As-You-Type".</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Ongoing Improvements</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        As we develop BabelFlow, we are actively seeking to build tools so
        people around the world can overcome existing language barriers present
        on the internet. Our grand vision is to unify the internet around the
        world so everyone can surf and interact together in this global network
        of communication. Our Translate As You Type tool is the first of the
        many features we hope to provide to help anyone around the world access
        the information they need, no matter the language.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">In the future we hope to provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improved translation accuracy by allowing the users to toggle between
          different translations or even entire translation models.
        </li>
        <li>
          Broader language support that allows any language to translate to any
          other language with great accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>Optimized performance for faster and more fluid communication.</li>
      </ul>
